## Purpose
Have you ever gotten ready to bike somewhere then you realized that its dark outside and you've forgotten your bike light? The purpose of this app is to prevent things like this from happening. Once you enter your location, and the time that you intend to use your bike, the app informs you about the weather conditions and whether you should bring a bike light with you.

## Technologies Used
The technologies that were used in the building of this app, are HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. The app also utilizes the OpenWeather API and the Weatherbit API for weather information.
